# StarRocks Community
Welcome to the StarRocks community!
This is the starting point for joining and contributing to the StarRocks community,improving code, docs,giving talks etc.

## Community Creed
* ### Tolerant and gather strength
The community will listen carefully to the voice of every member, whether it is technical 
discussions or communication about community culture, everyone can have different opinions and 
ideas (but this does not include attacks and discrimination against individuals, regardless of Nationality, religion, gender, etc.), 
the community always pursues the tremendous power brought by "Many hands make light work", which will lead the community to continue
to improve and move forward.

* ### Contribution brings growth, growth promotes success
The community welcomes and recognizes any form of contribution (new requirements, solutions, technical evangelism, etc.), 
not just code contributions. Every contribution is a growth for every member of the community. At the same time, 
continuous contribution also gives the community a strong vitality. This is a virtuous circle of common growth. Because of this, 
we believe that while the community is successful, it can also bring success to contributors.

* ### Ardently love can only be fully committed
Love to make ordinary things great. We cannot ask everyone to be full of love for participating in community building, 
but there will always be a group of people in the community who will tirelessly answer every help question, 
actively participate in every public discussion, and work hard to overcome every technical problem. Wrong, 
this is love. We look forward to you becoming one of them and passing on your love to others.
